            <big><h4>Post-secondary education</h4></big> <br>
           <p>In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elphinstone_High_School">Elphinstone High School</a> . In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match per the customs prevailing at that time was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage_in_the_Indian_subcontinent">arranged</a>  by the couple's parents.</p> <br><br>
           <br><li>
            <big><h4>Studies at the University of Bombay</h4></big> <br>
            <p>In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elphinstone_College"> Elphinstone College</a>, which was affiliated to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mumbai">University of Bombay</a> University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Buddha</a> by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.
              <br><br>  By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.</p></h4>

            <h4><big>Studies at Columbia University</big></h4><br><br>
            <p>In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayajirao_Gaekwad_III">Sayajirao Gaekwad III  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaekwad">(Gaekwad </a>of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroda_State"> Baroda)</a> that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University">Columbia University</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a> . Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallach_Hall">Livingston Hall</a> with Naval Bhathena, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis">Parsi</a> who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey"> John Dewey</a> and his work on democracy.
              <br><br>  In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Dividend of India - A Historic and Analytical Study, for a second M.A. On 9 May, he presented the paper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castes_in_India:_Their_Mechanism,_Genesis_and_Development">Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development</a> before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Goldenweiser_(anthropologist)">Alexander Goldenweiser.</a> Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at Columbia in 1927.

In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on a different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution". In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which was awarded from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London">University of London,</a> and the same year he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn.</p>
